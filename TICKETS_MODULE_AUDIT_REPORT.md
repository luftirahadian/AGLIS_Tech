## 🔧 **CRITICAL BUG FIXED**

### **Issue**: Ticket Status Update Failed
**Error**:
```
column "assigned_technician_id" of relation "ticket_status_history" does not exist
```

**Impact**: 
- ❌ Cannot update ticket status
- ❌ Cannot assign technicians
- ❌ Workflow completely broken

**Root Cause**:
- Code tried to INSERT assigned_technician_id into ticket_status_history
- Table doesn't have this column
- Query failed on every status update

**Solution**:
```javascript
// BEFORE (Broken)
INSERT INTO ticket_status_history (..., assigned_technician_id) 
VALUES (..., $6)

// AFTER (Fixed)
INSERT INTO ticket_status_history (ticket_id, old_status, new_status, changed_by, notes) 
VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5)
```

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**
