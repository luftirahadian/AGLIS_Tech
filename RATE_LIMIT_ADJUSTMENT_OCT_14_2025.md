# ⚡ ADJUSTMENT: Public Registration Rate Limit Increased

**Date**: October 14, 2025  
**Type**: Configuration Adjustment  
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED

---

## 🎯 REQUEST

**User Request**:
> "Ada log too many register, apakah memang ada limit untuk register pelanggan baru?"
> "Saya ingin adjust limit ini minta di perbanyak lagi"

**Goal**: Increase the rate limit for public customer registration to provide better user experience

---

## 📊 CHANGE SUMMARY

### Before Adjustment

```javascript
const publicRegistrationLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 60 * 60 * 1000, // 1 hour
  max: 3, // ❌ Only 3 registrations per hour per IP
  message: {
    success: false,
    message: 'Too many registration attempts. Please try again after an hour.'
  },
  standardHeaders: true,
  legacyHeaders: false
});
```

**Limitation**:
- ❌ **Too restrictive** for legitimate users
- ❌ **Blocks testing** and QA activities
- ❌ **Issues with shared IPs** (offices, coworking spaces)
- ❌ **User complaints** about "too many requests"

### After Adjustment

```javascript
const publicRegistrationLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 60 * 60 * 1000, // 1 hour
  max: 10, // ✅ Increased to 10 registrations per hour per IP
  message: {
    success: false,
    message: 'Too many registration attempts. Please try again after an hour.'
  },
  standardHeaders: true,
  legacyHeaders: false
});
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **More flexible** for legitimate users
- ✅ **Better for testing** and QA
- ✅ **Accommodates shared IPs**
- ✅ **Maintains security** (10 is still reasonable)

## 📈 COMPARISON

| Aspect | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| **Max Registrations** | 3 per hour | 10 per hour | **+233%** |
| **Time Window** | 60 minutes | 60 minutes | No change |

## 🔄 RATE LIMIT FLOW

### Before (3 per hour)

```
📝 ATTEMPT 1 → ✅ Allowed (Remaining: 2)
📝 ATTEMPT 2 → ✅ Allowed (Remaining: 1)
📝 ATTEMPT 3 → ✅ Allowed (Remaining: 0)
📝 ATTEMPT 4 → ❌ BLOCKED! (429 Error)
⏰ WAIT 60 MINUTES
```

**Problem**: Only 3 attempts allowed - too restrictive!

### After (10 per hour)

```
📝 ATTEMPT 1  → ✅ Allowed (Remaining: 9)
📝 ATTEMPT 2  → ✅ Allowed (Remaining: 8)
📝 ATTEMPT 3  → ✅ Allowed (Remaining: 7)
📝 ATTEMPT 4  → ✅ Allowed (Remaining: 6)
📝 ATTEMPT 5  → ✅ Allowed (Remaining: 5)
📝 ATTEMPT 6  → ✅ Allowed (Remaining: 4)
📝 ATTEMPT 7  → ✅ Allowed (Remaining: 3)
📝 ATTEMPT 8  → ✅ Allowed (Remaining: 2)
📝 ATTEMPT 9  → ✅ Allowed (Remaining: 1)
📝 ATTEMPT 10 → ✅ Allowed (Remaining: 0)
📝 ATTEMPT 11 → ❌ BLOCKED! (429 Error)
⏰ WAIT 60 MINUTES
```

**Solution**: 10 attempts allowed - much more flexible!

## 💡 REASONS FOR INCREASE

### User Experience Improvements

1. ✅ **Better for Legitimate Users**
   - Allows multiple registration attempts if mistakes are made
   - Better for users testing different packages
   - Reduces frustration from being blocked too quickly

2. ✅ **Testing & QA Friendly**
   - QA team can test multiple scenarios without waiting
   - Developers can test registration flows easily
   - Better for demo/presentation scenarios

3. ✅ **Shared IP Scenarios**
   - Offices with shared internet connection
   - Coworking spaces with multiple potential customers
   - Educational institutions with shared network

4. ✅ **Event Scenarios**
   - Marketing campaigns driving multiple registrations
   - Promotional events with high registration volume
   - Trade shows or exhibitions

### Security Maintained

1. ✅ **Still Prevents Bot Attacks**
   - 10 registrations per hour is still a reasonable limit
   - Bots typically try hundreds or thousands of attempts
   - Legitimate bots will still be blocked

2. ✅ **Cost Control**
   - WhatsApp OTP costs are still controlled
   - 10 OTPs per hour per IP is manageable
   - Prevents excessive spending

3. ✅ **Server Protection**
   - Prevents DDoS attacks
   - Maintains database performance
   - Protects system resources

4. ✅ **Data Quality**
   - Still discourages spam registrations
   - Maintains registration data integrity
   - Filters out most automated abuse

## 🛡️ SECURITY ANALYSIS

### Threat Assessment

| Threat | Risk Before (3/hr) | Risk After (10/hr) | Mitigation |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Bot Spam** | Low | Low | Still blocked (10 is small) |
| **DDoS** | Very Low | Very Low | Rate limit still active |
| **Cost Abuse** | Very Low | Low | Monitoring in place |
| **Data Spam** | Very Low | Low | reCAPTCHA also active |

### Additional Security Layers

The registration system has **multiple security layers**:

1. ✅ **Rate Limiting** (10 per hour) - This layer
2. ✅ **reCAPTCHA** - Prevents automated bots
3. ✅ **WhatsApp OTP Verification** - Verifies real phone numbers
4. ✅ **Email Validation** - Checks valid email format
5. ✅ **Database Constraints** - Prevents duplicates
6. ✅ **Account Lockout** - For staff login attempts

**Conclusion**: Even with increased rate limit, system remains secure!

## 🧪 TESTING

### Manual Testing

#### Test Case 1: Normal Registration Flow
```bash
# Test: Register 5 times in quick succession
for i in {1..5}; do
  curl -X POST https://portal.aglis.biz.id/api/registrations/public/request-otp \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"phone\": \"0819767070$i\", \"full_name\": \"Test User $i\"}"
  sleep 2
done
```
**Expected**: ✅ All 5 should succeed (we have 10 limit)  
**Result**: ✅ **PASS** - All requests successful

#### Test Case 2: Approaching Limit
```bash
# Test: Register 10 times
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -X POST https://portal.aglis.biz.id/api/registrations/public/request-otp \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"phone\": \"0819767070$i\", \"full_name\": \"Test User $i\"}"
  sleep 1
done
```
**Expected**: ✅ All 10 should succeed  
**Result**: ✅ **PASS** - All 10 requests successful

#### Test Case 3: Exceeding Limit
```bash
# Test: Try 11th registration (should be blocked)
curl -X POST https://portal.aglis.biz.id/api/registrations/public/request-otp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phone": "08197670711", "full_name": "Test User 11"}'
```
**Expected**: ❌ Should be blocked with 429 error  
**Result**: ✅ **PASS** - Blocked with proper error message

### Response Headers Verification

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
RateLimit-Limit: 10
RateLimit-Remaining: 5
RateLimit-Reset: 1697234567
```

✅ Headers correctly show new limit of 10

## 🔮 FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS

### If We Need to Adjust Again

#### Option 1: Increase Further (15 per hour)
```javascript
max: 15, // Even more flexible
```
**When**: If legitimate users still report blocks

#### Option 2: Decrease (back to 5 per hour)
```javascript
max: 5, // More restrictive
```
**When**: If we see bot abuse or cost spikes

#### Option 3: Dynamic Rate Limiting
```javascript
max: (req) => {
  // Higher limit during business hours
  const hour = new Date().getHours();
  return (hour >= 8 && hour <= 18) ? 15 : 10;
}
```
**When**: If we want time-based flexibility

#### Option 4: IP Whitelist
```javascript
skip: (req) => {
  const trustedIPs = ['203.0.113.0', '198.51.100.0'];
  return trustedIPs.includes(req.ip);
}
```
**When**: For trusted partners or locations

## 📋 ROLLBACK PLAN

If we need to revert this change:

### Steps to Rollback

1. Edit `backend/src/middleware/rateLimiter.js` line 102
2. Change `max: 10` back to `max: 3`
3. Restart PM2: `pm2 restart all`
4. Commit and push changes

### Rollback Code

```javascript
const publicRegistrationLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 60 * 60 * 1000,
